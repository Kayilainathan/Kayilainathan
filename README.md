# Hi there, I'm Kayilainathan 👋

I am an **Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering** undergraduate at **Madras Institute of Technology (MIT), Anna University** (Class of 2028). I am passionate about the intersection of digital logic design, embedded systems, and machine learning.

### 🛠️ Technical Skill Set
* **Digital Design:** Verilog HDL, RTL Design, FPGA Prototyping
* **Software & Tools:** Xilinx Vivado, Proteus, VS Code
* **Machine Learning:** Time-Series Forecasting, Predictive Maintenance (Kaggle Certified)
* **Embedded Systems:** ESP32, IoT System Architecture, Sensor Integration

### 🚀 Key Projects
* **Verilog Learning Journey:** A comprehensive log of RTL designs ranging from basic gates to complex arithmetic units and FSMs.
* **SIS Failure Predictor:** An AI-driven Safety Instrumented System failure predictor using Agentic AI to forecast system failures.
* **Smart Drainage System:** Award-winning IoT project developed with team 'TouchGrass.Devs' using ESP32 and flow sensors.

### 🎯 Current Focus
I am currently mastering **Advanced RTL Verification** and exploring **Agentic AI** applications in industrial automation. I am actively seeking summer internship opportunities for May-June 2026 in the VLSI and Core Electronics domains.
