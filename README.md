## Hi there 👋


**Kayilainathan/Kayilainathan** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Smart India Hackathon Project
- 🌱 I’m currently learning core concepts of electronics
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on IOT based projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with DSA in C,C++
- 💬 Ask me about PN Junction Diode, BJT, JFET, MOSFET
- 📫 How to reach me: linkedin.com/in/kayilainathan-j-170267305
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: The depletion layer in a PN junction diode acts like a bouncer at a club—it decides who gets to pass through and who doesn’t. And just like a real bouncer, it gets stricter when reverse bias is applied 😎🔌
